    "5. There are some case where date is single digit, if so we need to add 0 before the digit. So we are spliting the date and checking the length of date, if it is one we are adding zero before the digit while printing else we are printing the exact digit."

If the reviewers name is not in the dictionary, it will return error and run an infinite loop. If the user enter correct reviewer name it will call cosine method. If the user enters 2 reviewers name the it will call cosineSocre() function. If the user enter 1 reviewer name, then it will call cosineSocreForAll() function.\n",
    "6. cosineSocre() - we are passing our main dictionary and two reviers name. First we need to get the sub dict for each reviewer. Iterating nested for loop for each reviewer sub dict. if the keys of both sub dict is same then will square the values of respective keys and will make sum of all squares. Finally will return the square root of the sum of all squares.\n",
    "7. cosineSocreForAll() - it is similar to cosineSocre() function but here we are comparing with all other reviewers. We are passing our main dict and one reviewer name. First we are getting values for the given reviewer. Then we are iterating each key and values in the main dict and comparing the reviewer with user input reviewer name. If it not equal, we are initiating nested for loop with each values of sub dict and user reviewer values.Finally we adding cosine score, reviewer name and comparing reviewer name into the list and returning it."
